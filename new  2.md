8- Describe each variable role in your own words with examples.
fixed value-- holds a value that doesn't change, eg: NO_OF_RECENT_SCORES = 3
stepper-- goes through a number of predicted values
most recent holder-- stores the latest value in a process
most wanted holder-- stores the most appropriate value for the program
gatherer-- stores the total of values so far
transformation-- gets its value from other variables
follower-- the value of this is one of another one's old one
temporary-- holds value for a short time
9-difference between passing by value and passing by reference.
the variable uses a reference to the same memory location and is passed as a parameter 
the value is copied to the parameter.
